# Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Gabriel Simoes!

I've always been passionate about technology. In 2020 due to pandemic I've spent more time than ever at home and took the opportunity to dive into GNU/Linux universe as an enthusiast. I could spend many hours studying, setting up stuff on my VPS, solving problems and automating tasks. That's when I realized how much I enjoy it and decided to change career to software development.

## Achievements

Upwork's Top Rated Badge: As a freelancer system administrator, I've been in contact with multiple customers all around the globe, providing solutions and building a strong reputation by getting consistent positive feedback.

## Current interests

My short-term goal is to get hired as a Full-Stack Developer. In order to achieve it I'm focused on mastering Javascript â€” more specifically the MERN stack and building an outstanding portfolio.
